# 🎯 Guess the Number – Version 2

This is the **second version** of my Python number guessing game. In this version, the computer generates a **5-digit non-repeating number**, and the player has 10 chances to guess it. After every guess, the player receives hints on how many digits are correct and how many are in the correct position.

## 🕹️ How the Game Works

1. The computer generates a **random 5-digit number** (no repeated digits in easy mode).
2. You get **10 chances** to guess the number.
3. After each guess, you'll be told:
   - ✅ How many digits are **correct** (anywhere in the number)
   - 📍 How many digits are in the **correct position**
4. If all digits are guessed correctly in the right positions, **you win**!
5. If not, you lose after 10 attempts.
